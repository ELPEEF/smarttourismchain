== Frequently Asked Questions ==

1. Is this plugin connected to real blockchain payments?
No. The current version runs on Ethereum **Sepolia testnet**, allowing you to simulate transactions **safely and freely**.  
You can deploy your own smart contract to **mainnet or Layer 2** when you're ready.

2. Why should I install a testnet plugin?
Because this plugin:  
- Prepares you for **real blockchain adoption**
- Enables **hands-on experience** with Web3 in tourism  
- Can be **extended to production use** with your own token, contract, and payment flow

3. Can I use my own smart contract?
Yes. The system is flexible. You can insert your own smart contract address and ABI for full customization.

4. Is there a PRO version?
Yes, a PRO version with **white-label features**, **API access**, and **real token integration** is available at https://smartourism.elpeef.com
